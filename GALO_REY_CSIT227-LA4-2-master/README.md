Implement the following classes based on the following description.  
A Person could either be an Employee or Customer. An Employee could be a Manager, a Developer, or just a regular Employee.

# The Classes

## Person

All Persons have the following private fields: a **name** and an **age**. Declare name as final since it would not ever be changed after constructing. Create a public getter for both. All Persons also celebrate `birthday()`s that prints "Happy birthday, name!" and they grow one year older. They could also `performTask()` that returns nothing but its implementation is to be performed on its subclasses. Whenever a Person is printed, it will print the name and the age enclosed in parenthesis, i.e., "name (age)".  
For the age, make sure that it is valid. If it is negative, throw an `IllegalArgumentException` with message “Age must be non-negative”

## Employee

The Employee is a Person that has the following field: double **salary**. Create a public getter and a protected setter for this field. The Employee's `performTask()` will simply print the following: name " is working". Whenever an Employee is printed, it would also have its salary listed after, i.e., "name (age) - salary", and there is no particular formatting for the salary's decimal places. As we attempt to promote reusability, try not to implement the same printing of the name and age again, but instead use the concept of inheritance, similar to the other tasks in this problem.  
For the salary, make sure that it cannot go lower than 30,000. If it does, throw an `IllegalArgumentException` with message “Salary must be greater than or equal to 30000”

## Manager
A Manager is an Employee that shall have a public method `giveRaise(Employee, double)` given the Employee and the increase that shall increase the Employee's current salary with the increase. Half of that increase shall also be added to the Manager's own salary. If the Employee in the argument is the Manager itself, then only the first one shall apply. For the `giveRaise()` method, you must use the setter to set the Employee's salary. The said method must check the increase for validation such that it would not process negative values and shall instead print "Invalid increase". Additionally, when the Manager object is printed, it will have to be prepended by the abbreviation "Mgr."  
For the raise in the `giveRaise()`, make sure that it is valid. If it is negative, throw an `IllegalArgumentException` with message “Raise must be non-negative”


## Developer
A Developer is an Employee that has a Manager **projectManager**. Create a public getter and protected setter for this field. The setter must only set the project manager when there is none, otherwise throw exception name " already has a manager". The Developer also has a method `removePM()` where it unassigns the developer's project manager. When a Developer has his birthday, the projectManager, if any, must also give him a raise amounting to 5% of the Developer's current salary. This must use the getter method of the salary; if there is no project manager, the Developer would not get a raise. Additionally, the performTask of the Developer must be changed to name "is coding". Additionally, when the Developer object is printed and it has a project manager, it will also output the name of the project manager inside square brackets i.e., "name (age) - salary [PM name]".  
For the `setProjectManager()` as mentioned above, when the developer already has a manager, throw an `IllegalStateException` with message “name already has a manager: managername”

## Customer
A Customer is a Person that will print name " is browsing through" in its `performTask()` method. It also has a method `speak(Employee)` where it will print "Oh, hello, [employee name]. Can you assist me?", except when the Employee is a Developer and the Customer's age is more than the Developer's age, in which case it will instead ask "Can I see your manager [name of manager]?"

Additionally, implement the static methods in `Main`. All methods will have the list of persons and a series of other parameters including strings for the names of the persons involved.  
When the name is found and it is not the desired type, throw a `ClassCastException` with the message “name is not a/n type” where type is the desired type.  
When the name is not at all found in the list of persons, throw a `NoSuchElementException` with the message “name does not exist”
